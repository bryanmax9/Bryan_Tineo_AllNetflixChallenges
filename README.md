# Bryan_Tineo_AllNetflixChallenges

Welcome to Bryan_Tineo_AllNetflixChallenges! This repository contains projects that I completed during my time at Netflix Bootcamp. In these projects, I worked on REST APIs using Spring, Docker, DBeaver, Insomnia, and other tools and technologies.

## Challenge 3
My team and I developed a RESTful API using Java and the Spring framework. The API features a hardcoded database to simulate three endpoints. The first endpoint is a GET request that returns random words with their respective definitions. The second endpoint is also a GET request that generates random quotes along with their authors. The third endpoint is an 8-ball API that is accessible through a POST request. This endpoint allows a user to submit a question, which will then generate a random answer from the 8-ball API.
